						<div class="definition">
							<p>Generally, the Jet engine is also known as a gas turbine engine is a reaction engine that discharges a fast-moving
								stable jet that generates thrust by jet propulsion and the turbine placed upstream of the hot jet flow (static
								pressure and energy-rich combustion chamber outlet gases) will extract the energy from the exhaust jet to run
								multi-staged rotors assembled to the same rotating central shaft, in which the turbine assembly is attached on to.
								Which transmits the energy from the turbine to the axial compressor multistage rotors, is located in a certain
								required number of stages (selection of “n’’ is flexible through the static pressure requirement of the whole engine
								design) alternatively in between the multi-stage stator assemblies, all together in a converging annulus volume
								leading from the very upstream of the incoming airflow after diffuser till the very inlet of the combustion chamber
								housing units. In the most common design, around the circumferential void volume leads from the outlet of the axial
								compressor housing and the inlet of turbine housing unit, which is around the circumferential volume of the central
								shaft, is all bolted together by metal seals sandwiched in between the bolted joints, there are multiple numbers of
								combustion chamber units set in between axial compressor outlet and the turbine inlet.
								<br><br>
								The combustion chamber is designed in such a way to mix the fuel and the compressed static pressure and heat-rich
								air for efficient sustained combustion, equipped with a spark plug of a continuous electric arc formed in between
								the two electrodes placed inside the combustion chamber. The fuel nozzle unit is placed inside the combustion
								chamber, very behind the electric arc forming electrodes of the continuous spark plug, to obtain a continuous
								atomized flow of aviation fuel with required fuel pressure directly onto the continuous electric arc.
								<br><br>
								The fuel injector is connected to a fuel manifold which is connected with a fuel reservoir and a fuel pump, which
								constantly pumps the fuel with the required fuel pressure. The combusted hot energized gas jet streams are entered
								into the turbine housing which comprises one or two stages of the turbine cycle with an annular set of nozzle blades
								and the turbine rotor reaction blades, which will extract energy from already energized gas streams expanding from
								the combustion chamber.
								<br><br>
								At the nozzle of the jet engine, the exhaust gas streams after the turbine will expand into exponentially higher
								velocity jet streams, as the reaction to the action triggered by these high-velocity jet streams is the output
								created by the gas turbine engines, generally known as thrust.<br><br>
								The major applications of gas turbine engines are in different domains are as follows: -
								<br><br>
								To propel the aircraft using a massive power output delivery to keep the aircraft airborne for the required
								applications like civil/private transportation and cargo, to help the all sets of maneuvering needs of the aircraft
								by using gas turbine jet engines as the appropriate power plants for the aircraft.<br>
								To power the marine cargo vessels/heavy-duty vessels, big yachts, civilian transportation ships, and cruise ships.
								To provide shaft power for the rotary-wing aircrafts such as helicopters and choppers. The shaft power produced by
								the gas turbine engine is transferred through the central shaft which is equipped with a gearbox, which is then
								linked through a gearbox to the main rotor-wing assembly.<br>
								To power, the industries, gas turbine power is used as the main source of power generation in some industries.
								<br><br>
								In aeronautical engineering, the overall pressure ratio, or overall compression ratio, is the ratio of the
								stagnation pressure as measured at the front and rear of the compression of a gas turbine engine. The terms
								compression ratio and pressure ratio are interchangeable, overall compression ratio also means the overall cycle
								pressure ratio which includes intake ram. A higher overall pressure ratio implies higher efficiency, but the engine
								will usually weigh more, so there is a compromise between the weight of the engine and the pressure ratio. A higher
								overall pressure ratio permitted a larger area nozzle to be fitted on the jet engine. This means that more of the
								heat energy is converted to jet-speed, and energetic efficiency improves. This is reflected in improvements in the
								engine’s specific fuel consumption.<br><br>
								Fuel efficiency and power-to-weight ratio are important factors to be considered while designing any fuel-consuming
								engine or system. High fuel-efficient systems with less weight are more efficient in extracting high outputs.in the
								case of aircraft and industrial jet engines, the operational cost and power output are equally important, thus there
								stands a need for an engine, which can extract the required power output with limited fuel consumption and less
								weight compared to the conventional engines.<br><br>
								Axial flow compressors are integral to the design of large gas turbines such as jet engines, high-speed ship
								engines, and small-scale power stations. They are also used in industrial applications such as large volume air
								separation plants, blast furnace air, fluid catalytic cracking air, and propane dehydrogenations. Due to high
								performance, high reliability, and flexible operation during the flight envelope, they are also used widely in
								aerospace engines.<br><br>
								The function of a compressor is generally to raise the pressure of a specified mass flow of a gas by a prescribed
								amount using the minimum power output. The axial compressor consists of rotating and stationary components. A shaft
								drives a central drum which is retained by bearings inside of a stationary tubular casing. Between the drum and the
								casing are rows of airfoils, and each row is connected to either the drum or the casing in an alternating manner. A
								pair of one row of rotating airfoils and the next row of stationary airfoils is called one stage. The rotating
								airfoils, also known as blades or rotors, accelerate the fluids in both the axial and circumferential directions.
								The stationary airfoils, also known as vanes or stators, convert the increased kinetic energy into static pressure
								through diffusion and redirect the flow direction of the fluid to prepare it for the rotor blades of the next stage.
								Pressure rises are obtained through successive stages of diffusing passages with a consequent reduction in velocity.
								The cross-sectional area between the rotor drum and casing is reduced in the flow direction to maintain an optimum
								Mach number axial velocity as the fluid is compressed. Axial flow compressors produce a continuous flow of
								compressed gas and have the benefits of high efficiency and large mass flow rate, particularly in relation to their
								size and cross-section. They do, however, require several rows of airfoils to achieve a large pressure rise, making
								them complex and expensive, relative to other designs (e.g., centrifugal compressors). this all shows an inevitable
								need for an updated and more appropriate design for the axial compressor to reduce the number of stages and to
								achieve a more efficient pressure rise from the minimum turbine energy transmitted through the shaft.<br>
								The compressor consumes over 55-60% of the total power generated by the gas turbine. therefore, compressor problems,
								such as fouling, can have a significant impact on turbine performance. Pressure ratios have increased from about 7:1
								in the 1950s to 35:1 in the 2000s. the safe operating range of the compressor, at a constant speed, stretches from
								the surge line at the low flow end of the compressor constant speed line to the choke point at the high flow end.
								This operational range difference can be about 2.5-3.5 % of the design flow. The lower pressure compressor has a
								larger operational range than the higher-pressure compressor. therefore, the higher-pressure ratio compressors are
								more susceptible to fouling, and this can result in surge problems or blade excitation problems, which can lead to
								blade failures. A drop in pressure ratio at the turbine inlet due to filter fouling results in a substantial loss in
								the turbine’s overall efficiency and power produced. Hence the reduction of many blades and stages without
								compromising the output pressure ratio is safer.<br><br>
								In industrial gas turbine engines, there are trends towards using water injection at the inlet or between compressor
								sections, which is likely to affect airfoil life due to erosion effects. This clearly shows the need for a heat
								transfer management process within the axial compressor as its integral part.<br><br>
								The trend in axial flow compressors towards fewer airfoils(30-35 first stage blades as compared with 40 earlier),
								thinner blades(thickness to chord ratio has decreased from 0.1 to 0.08), bigger airfoil diameter(increased from 5-6
								ft to 8-10 ft), and use of three dimensional and controlled-diffusion-airfoil blades(3D/CDA).but still, this trend
								forces to increase the number of stages, which will increase three weight and complexity of jet engines.in turn,
								this will increase the gross weight and complexity of operation for both industrial and aircraft jet engines. The
								blades have similar clearances and higher loading per stage (pressure ratio per stage, having gone from 1.14 to
								1.18). performance of the axial compressor is sensitive to the condition of the rotor blades. Dirt on blades, due to
								poor filtration and maintenance practices, can be a significant source of performance deterioration. Compressor
								deterioration in turbine performance is indicated by slower engine acceleration, engine compressor surge or stall,
								lower power output, loss of engine compressor discharge pressure, and increase in compressor discharge temperature.
								thus, reducing the number of rotor blades and stator blades(reduction in blade loading) is more appropriate if a
								proper solution is applied for achieving competent pressure rise with’ ‘lesser number ‘of blades and stages. thus,
								there is a need to reduce the number of blades and stages without affecting the required pressure ratio. There is
								also a need to attain the required static pressure rise from the incoming axial flow with a lesser number of stages
								and the number of blades of both stator’s annular rows and rotor’s annular rows in an axial compressor assembly.
								It can be clearly understood that to keep the required thrust constant or a bit higher than usual, it is possible to
								keep the mass flow rate low, by keeping the operational RPM of the engine low. Therefore, increasing the jet
								velocity substantially, by allowing static pressure to be expanded at the nozzle, altogether will help in improving
								the aerodynamic efficiency of the flow over rotor and stator blades, combustion efficiency, turbine efficiency, and
								eventually the fuel efficiency of the jet engine as a whole.<br><br>
								The principal objective of the present invention is to attain the required static pressure rise from the incoming
								axial flow with a lesser number of stages and a lesser number of blades in an axial flow compressor assembly. This
								will reduce the TSFC (thrust specific fuel consumption) by extracting the required pressure ratio from the incoming
								axial flow and an increase in power to weight ratio, due to the reduction in weight and dimensions. Thus, TSFC will
								decrease substantially, and will in turn help to reduce the complexity and cost of maintenance of the axial
								compressor parts like rows of stator and rotor blades.<br><br>
								One or more shortcomings of conventional systems are overcome and additional advantages are provided through the
								provision of a system disclosed in the present disclosure. Additional features and advantages are realized through
								the techniques of the present disclosure.<br><br>
								A stator is disclosed, which is adapted to redirect the flow of a fluid in an axial flow compressor. It comprises a
								plurality of elongated structures, with curved contours along with an elongated geometry and two vertices.
								Cantilever support is physically coupled to a surface of the structure at the elongated geometry. An outer casing is
								physically coupled to the cantilever support, wherein the elongated structure is aligned such that a length of the
								elongated structure, which is defined as the distance between two vertices, is substantially parallel to a width of
								the adjacent stator blades in the same row of the particular stage attached to the outer casing. In an embodiment,
								the elongated structure may be asymmetric or symmetric and is formed by physically coupling two conical structures
								at a circular base of the conical structure. The cantilever support is physically coupled to a surface of the
								elongated structure at the elongated geometry about a center of a central axis passing through the vertices of the
								elongated structure.
								<br><br>
								A plurality of blades is provided, extending from the outer casing. The stator further comprises an inner casing,
								wherein the blades extending from the outer casing are physically coupled to the inner casing or not coupled to the
								inner casing, wherein the elongated structures are placed between the blades, such that the length of the elongated
								structure is substantially parallel to a width of the blade. The distance between the central axis of the elongated
								structure is lesser than the height of the blades, and the length of the elongated structure is equal to or slightly
								lesser than the width of the blade.<br><br>
							
								Key advantages of this product are-<br>
								1) A well-improved breakthrough fuel economy.<br>
								2) Increase in turbine efficiency.<br>
								3) Increase in propulsion efficiency.<br>
								4) Increase in power to weight ratio.<br>
								5) Increase in aerodynamic efficiency.<br>
								6) Decrease in compressor surge and stall probability.<br>
								7) Boundary layer separation will delay.<br>
								8) Wear and tear will decrease.<br>
								9) A substantial reduction in the maintenance frequency and cost as well.<br>
								high stoichiometric burn.<br>
							
								10) Many stages and dimensions of the jet engine will be reduced.<br>
								11) Adverse pressure gradient can be treated.<br>
								12) Life of the engine will be improved.<br>
								13) Well-improved wake mixing and wake transportation, thus proper utilization of wakes, resulting in a very low
								mixing loss coefficient. almost null.<br><br>
							
								The present invention helps in reducing TSFC (thrust specific fuel consumption) of aircraft/industrial jet engines.
								This is achieved by a reduction in the number of stages and number of blades in annulus rows of blades by achieving
								the same required static pressure ratio/high static pressure ratio (flexible technology according to the needs and
								requirements of particular jet engines) as in the increased number of stage axial compressor complex model. This is
								done by introducing base integrated symmetric or asymmetric double cones (elongated structure with support from the
								outer casing where the blades are attached into by placing this particular simple system in the column in between
								two consecutive blades /or even placing this system arranged annularly without the blades too. This results in a
								higher power to weight ratio for the whole jet engine by the reduction in the material used to manufacture. This
								further helps to bring down the maintenance cost of the jet engines substantially. It also reduces the probability
								of boundary layer formation over both rotor and blades by reducing the number of blades used. The present invention
								will help in increasing the power to weight ratio substantially by reducing the number of stages and the dimensions
								of the jet engine will extract maximum power output from a lower mass flow rate by a substantial reduction in the
								engine drag.<br><br>
							
							
								There happens a convective heat transfer from the axial airflow to the elongated structure, and then a conductive
								heat transfer from the elongated structure to the outer casing of the jet engine or vice versa, thereby acting as a
								fin (heat convention) inside the axial flow compressor. This helps to keep down the margin of the very high
								temperature (the added temperature of the flow which is against the adiabatic process over air compression)
								generation per stage while generating the required high static pressure ratio per stage. This will help to keep the
								outlet temperature of the axial compressor nominal, especially when it generates a high-pressure ratio per stage
								will tend to attain abnormal temperature rise per stage.<br><br>
							
								The present invention helps in keeping the RPM (rotation per minute) of the engine low, so that, the engine can
								extract required thrust at reduced RPMs, which will again result in sound reduction and will help to reduce the
								atrocity of gas turbine engines and reduced mass flow rate. Also, increased exit velocity results in higher
								aerodynamic efficiency, combustion efficiency, and turbine efficiency as well. This will help increase the turbine
								efficiency and the comparatively cooled turbines by the reduced rpm operation, and will also keep the turbine rpm
								low which will defend the temperature increment occurred by stoichiometric combustion.<br><br>
							
								The present invention helps to reduce the blade loading, as a result, the required pressure rise can be attained by
								using the volume in between blades as pressure generators by making use of the design and process of the present
								invention, which will use the ram pressure due to forward movement of aircraft as a bonus in case of aircraft jet
								engines to generate more static pressure. The ratio of the work done to the peripheral velocity of rotor blade
								squared is the blade loading coefficient, which is a dimensionless parameter, usually blade loading is assessed by
								the diffusion factor, blade loading coefficient should be high enough for an axial compressor, and by employing the
								present invention, enough can be extracted.<br><br>
							
								The present invention highly contributes towards the solution for unsteady, non-uniform axial flow (radial direction
								of the compressor, reduced work done factor due to non-uniform axial flow (radial) and due to a greater number of
								stages), but the present invention helps to make the axial flow (radial) steady and uniform. It further helps to
								reduce the number of stages without the compromise of required static pressure. This results in high work done
								factor, which for an axial compressor stage is an empirical factor introduced to account for non-uniformity of the
								velocity profile in the blade passages.<br><br>
							
								The present invention further deals with the generation of adverse pressure gradient due to the increase in static
								pressure rise through the axial flow direction. This is a major threat prevented by contributing the first portion
								of the invention, that is the hollow/solid double cones in the blade passage with an axial flow acceleration
								phenomenon at the first portion by decreasing the cross-sectional area of the blade passage initially, according to
								the Bernoulli’s mass flowrate equation, when the cross-sectional area increases, the velocity of the flow increases.
								The elongated structures in between the blade passage will help in generating a laminar overall flow with a
								turbulent boundary layered flow in between the blade and the elongated structures overlapping boundary layer through
								blade passage also prevent boundary layer separation, adverse pressure gradient, and its negative effects and the
								major aerodynamic losses. The rich laminar flow will be directed perfectly towards the rotor blades, and will also
								prevent the boundary layer separation generation tendency on the rotor blade surfaces and in the gap in between the
								rotor blades. Turbulent boundary layers tend to be able to sustain an adverse pressure gradient better than an
								equivalent laminar boundary layer.<br><br>
								This product is mainly based on Base Integrated Symmetrically or Asymmetrically Rationed Double Cones (BISARDC),
								which is supported by cantilever support and is implemented in between blades/in controlled annulus column volume of
								axial flow compressor stator vanes. The elongated structures are conical structures, with a circular base,
								comprising two vertices. The cantilever support is physically coupled to the elongated structure about the center of
								the central axis passing through vertices of the elongated structure and is physically coupled to the outer casing
								from its other end, thereby providing strong support to the elongated structure. The elongated structure is aligned
								in such a way that the length of the elongated structure, which is defined as the distance between two vertices, is
								substantially parallel to the width of the outer casing.<br>
